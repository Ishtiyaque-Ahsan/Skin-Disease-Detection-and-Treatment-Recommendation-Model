# Skin-Disease-Detection-and-Treatment-Recommendation-Model

Skin Disease Detection, Severity Classification, and Treatment Recommendation System  

        (BTech Major Project)	                                       (In Progress)
        
        • Developed a Deep Learning-based Skin Disease Detection System across 10 skin disease categories.
        
        • Implemented CNN architecture using ‘Transfer Learning’ (Fine Tuning) with ‘EfficientNetB3 Model’ for disease detection. 
           
        • Implement Treatment Recommendation System as a Chatbot System using ‘RAG Technique’ with ‘Gemini 2.0 Flash’ LLM Model.

        • Future Work: To integrate Severity Classification Feature to show mild, moderate, severe conditions.
